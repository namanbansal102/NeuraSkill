## ⚡ Key Features

### 🏗️ Core Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Decentralized Hackathon Hosting** | Create and manage events directly on TRN smart contracts, ensuring full transparency. |
| **Smart Build Submission** | Projects are uploaded to IPFS; their hashes are recorded immutably on‑chain. |
| **Token‑Backed Voting** | Upvoting requires locking Flow (or any token accepted by the fee proxy), discouraging spam and Sybil attacks. |
| **AI‑Driven Evaluation** | Machine‑learning models score submissions on code quality, innovation, and impact. |
| **Instant Prize Distribution** | Rewards are released automatically to winners’ TRN addresses the moment judging concludes. |

### 🔥 Platform Extensions
- **NFT Certificates** – Mintable proof‑of‑participation and victory, tradeable in any TRN NFT marketplace.  
- **Developer Reputation** – On‑chain score that aggregates wins, submissions, and community feedback.  
- **Team Formation Hub** – Skill‑tag matching helps hackers discover ideal teammates before events.  
- **Analytics Dashboard** – Real‑time stats on submissions, votes, AI scores, and gas fees.  
- **DAO Governance** – Token‑weighted proposals decide future feature rollouts and fee parameters.
